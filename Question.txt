All leaf nodes has depth which has single digit in key because we suppose all char has single digit depth in homework.
Let's assume when we build tree, "A" char has two-digits and "C" has one-digit depth in key.
 We give their binary password and their depth which has 3-digit size. 
Then,Our Code will suppose that "A" char has single digit (even if it has two-digit originally.) and "C" has single digit which is second digits of "A".This makes problem.
All leaf nodes must have a single digit depth in the key
